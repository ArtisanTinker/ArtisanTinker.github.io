# Head First Python


# Lists

```
movies = ["Terminator", "About Time"]

```

* Lists are like arrays - movies[0]

```
len(movies)
pop() # take one
append([item]) # add one 
extend([items,another]) # add multiple
remove(1)
insert(0,item)
```

## Lists within lists
```
movies = ["Terminator",
  ["Linda","Arnie"]
]

print movies[0][2]

```

## Checking Type
```
isinstance(movies,list)
```



# Functions

```
def myfunction():
  print('great')

```


## Loops:

```
for each movie in movies:
  print(movie)
  
while count < len (movies):
  print(movies[count])
  count = count+1
```
