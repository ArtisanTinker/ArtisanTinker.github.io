# Laravel Elixir

Managed to get this working, last week. All my assets are now built and versioned. Just adding a few notes from Matt's book.


## Assets

/resources/assets/

These export to public/


**Elixir can also run tests**

** gulp --production will minify **

## Source Maps
Explains the magical way you can debug the individual files with Chrome.


# Message Bags

I think I should have been using these to pass errors back up. (pg87)
withErrors adds to the MessageBag

## Named Error Bags

# String Helpers

starts_with
ends_with
str_contains
str_is
str_slug
str_plural

# Localisation

Use this if I ever need translations.
