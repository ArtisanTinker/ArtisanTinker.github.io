# DRY Datatables Template

I have several tables which need maintaining and I want to stay as DRY as possible. 
What I want is a Blade template which I can just throw some arrays at and it will display and editable Datatable.
This will then get used in all my applications and save a lot of time.


## Controller

Table
Table Headers

Datatables Ajax


## View
