## Why?

Being an average developer is not good enough for me, it's time for an upgrade. It's time to go from average to awesome.

## Goals
* Improve Vue.js skills - Vuerouter and Vuex
* Update Laravel Knowledge
* What CSS Framework?

## Steps

1.  https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-vue-and-spas/
2. VueSchool

### Vue-router
https://vueschool.io/lessons/create-a-new-project-with-vue-router-using-the-vue-cli-ui
* Map different states to different URLs giving you virtual pages.
* Doesn't reload, just swaps component.

Routes in /router/index.js
main.js mounts the app

App.vue is the single page.
```
<router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |

//renders the component
<router-view />

```

New routes need to be registered in the routes array/



### vue-cli
```
vue ui
```


### Vuex
* Way to manage the data as complexity increases.
* Centralizes application data in a central store.
