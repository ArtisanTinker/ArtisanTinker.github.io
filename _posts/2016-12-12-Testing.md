# Testing!

Laravel comes with:

* PHPUnit - unit testing
* Behat - behaviour-driven development
* Mockery - mocking
* Faker - fake data

# Basics

ExampleTest.php extends TestCase.php

To run:

'''
./vendor/bin/phpunit
'''

* Test names must end with Test
* Methods must start with the name test -or a @test docblock

Environment name: local,staging or production.
Can be used in control structures.

**.env variables come from phpunit.xml**

## The Testing Traits

### WithoutMiddleware
-disables middleware

### DatabaseMigrations
* All migrations are run for each test


### DatabaseTransactions
* Use an existing DB
* Rolls back transactions after testing


## Application Testing

* extend TestCase

## Clicking and Forms

*pg275*


## Mocking

Used to create a class that mimics a real class because real class is too difficult to instantiate.
