# Datatables or Laravel

How do I handle CRUD applications? Let Datatables do thw work? Let Laravel do the work via a REST interface?

## Pros and Cons

## REST

Softdeletes
Easier for auditing
Give me more Laravel experience

Validation when using Editor no possible

## Datatables

Hard to customise


## What am I doing currently?

Use Datatables with the REST interface.

Handle the store and delete myself.
Let Datatables do the edit?
