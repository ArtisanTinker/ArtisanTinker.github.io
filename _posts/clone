# How can I create a  test copy of my project?

1. Do a git clone.
git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/glostselection selectionTestEnv

2. create the httpd entry /etc/httpd/conf

3. composer install

4. copy the .env 


There maybe some problems with Auth stuff because I have changed the login to username and added the permissions stuff in AuthenticatesUsers.php.



# The GIT stuff
based on http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Develop Branch
-work on this, then merge to master - tag with a release (git hook)
