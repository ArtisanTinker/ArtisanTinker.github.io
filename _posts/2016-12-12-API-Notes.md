#API Development (Based on Laravel up and Running )

## REST Representational State Transfer

### What is a REST-ful API

* Structured around resources
* Primarily use HTTP verbs
* Stateless
* Consistent
* Return JSON



### In Laravel
 
* Use resource controllers
* index - lists all
* show - show single
* store - save one
* edit - show the edit view
* update - updates
* destroy - removes



### Returning JSON
If you return a collection from a route, it will be JSON

- return Cat::all()



## Headers


* Send non content information using headers

### Sending response headers in Laravel
```
return response (Cat::all())->header('X-thinkymeebob',9);
```

### Reading request headerss in Laravek
  
```
$request->header('thinkymeebob');
```


## Pagination

Just use paginate() instead of all()

```
return Cat::paginate(20);
return DB::table('cats')->paginate(20);

```

How to Get

GET /cats?page=x


**Also returns next page information**


## Sorting and Filtering

**No sorting in Laravel** (Isn't that what a DB is for? )

Just do an order by.


## Filtering

pg 293 Laravel Up and Running


## Transforming Results

** Use Fractal **


## Nesting and Relationships

Read *Build APIs You Won't Hate

* Embed resources in the primary resource

* Embed just the foreign keys

* ?

* Subresourse

* Optional embedding


## API Authentication with Laravel Passport

**Passport (Laravel 5.3 Only) makes it easy to set up an  OAuth 2.0 server**

**OAuth - book Matt Frost**

* Install with composer (297)
* Migrate
* Client apps pass a token (as a Bearer token)

### Guzzle - send HTTP request

Basically sending a GET (or other verb) from PHP.

## Passport's API

/oauth prefix

1. Authorize users with with OAuth
2. Allow users to manage their clients and tokens

### Passport's Available Grant Types

Authenticate users in four ways

1. Password grant - less common - username,password - mobile app
2. Authorisation  - most common - most complex - like Twitter/Facebook - token to communicatee
3. Personal - tokens for testing API or when using API
4. Synchroniser - tokens from the Laravel session

### Is Synchroniser the one for me?

* Already authenticated users
* AJAX
* JSON Web Token with CSRF

## Scopes


## JSON API Spec

A document must contain at least one of :

* data
* errors
* meta
