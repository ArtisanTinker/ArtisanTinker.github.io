# Dashboard Project

## Background

My next project is to create a dashboard application. This needs to be as flexible as possible, so that we can display graphs and Datatables from multiple sources.


## Technology

I have made some good progress with the frontend, we really wanted resizable, drag and drop widgets (hate that word, but don't know what else to use)
. I have got this working, using Gridstack.js and Vue.js (also my first Vue project!).

### Assets
I have also started to use Laravel Elixir (which uses gulp) to build and version my assets! This is a great step forward and will now do it in all my projects. 



##Progress

I'm just refactoring the front end, the JS is all in the Blade template and I need to move it out now it is working.
I was watching some Laracon videos and saw in this [Amanda Folson - Laracon Talk](https://streamacon.com/video/laracon-us/amanda-folson-apis-with-lumen)
that she suggested using Fractal, so I m currently trying to get that working.

I'm also reading *Build APIS You Won't Hate* (Phil Sturgeon).
