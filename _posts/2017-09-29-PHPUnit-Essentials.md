# PHPUnit Essentials

Just notes while working through this book.

I'm currently forcing myself to TDD everything I right.

Ideally I would be able to get XDebug working with my tests. This will be my first attempt. May not be easy because of my remote desktop stack :-(.

Xdebug is already installed on my dev box.

Remote CLI is missing, created a ticket with JetBrains. 
Updated PHPStorm and installed all plugins (this seemed to be plugin related).
Corected path mappings and debugging is now working!
