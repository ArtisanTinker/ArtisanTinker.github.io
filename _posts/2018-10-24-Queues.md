# Queues

* Config is in ```queue.php```
* Each connection has a default queue

# Dispatching jobs
```
Job::dispatch();

Job::dispatch()->onQueue('emails');
```

* When using multiple queues, priorities can be set:

```
php artisan queue:work --queue=high,default

```

# Creating Jobs

```
php artisan make:job ProcessPodcast
```

* Jobs have a handle method - called when the job is processed
* Can pass model into the constructor
* **The model is retrieved when the job is executed, not when it is placed in the queue**

# Dispatching Jobs

```
ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast);

ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)
  ->delay(now()->addMinutes(10));
  
```

## Job Chaining

```
ProcessPodcast::withChain([
  new OptimizePodcast,
  new ReleasePodcast
])->dispatch();
```

### Chain Connection and Queue

```
ProcessPodcast::withChain([
  new OptimizePodcast,
  new ReleasePodcast
])->dispatch()->allOnCOnnection('redis')->allOnQueue('podcasts');

```

## Customizing Queue and Connection

### Dispatching To a Particular Queue

```
ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)->onQueue('processing');
```

### Dispatching To a Particular Connection

```
ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)->onConnection('sqs');
```

### Specifying Mac Job Attempts /Timeout Values

#### Max Attempts

**On the queue worker**
```
php artisan queue:work --tries=3
```

**On the job itself**
```
public tries =5;
```

#### Time Based Attempts

Instead of specifying the number of retries, you can set the retry period (on the job class):

```
public function retryUntil()
{
  return now()->addSeconds(5);
}

```

#### Timeout
Can be set on the queue worker:

```
php artisan queue:work --timeout-30
```
or on the job:

```
public $timeout = 120; //seconds
```

### Rate Limiting
If using Redis - can throttle queued jobs - eg: can only run 10 times in 60 seconds
