## Colin Decarlo

How do I become a good developer?
* Gang of 4 Design Patterns - hard to understand
* Good ideas but not really for web development

## The Adapter Pattern
* Sits between two components with incompatible interfaces
* Converts the messages
* Good to sit between external APIs to buffer from change.
* Adapter class implements Locator
* Bind in AppServiceProvider
* Tests for 3rd party API or API which communicates over network - make a Fake class.


## The Strategy Pattern
* Me: Just use an interface for a family of classes, this forces them to use the same methods and makes them interchangeable. 
* E.g. A stratery for parsing each type of record 20:21
* Determine which strategy (class) to use 


## The Factory Pattern
