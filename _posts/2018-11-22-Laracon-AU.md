## Preventative Patterns
Do this on every app no matter what.

## Reactive Patterns
Feek/see the pain, then choose the fix
There is a need.

**Problem: we just use patterns without first identifying a need **
We just want to use the favourite tool.

** Don't do stuff you don't need **

** Cost of change **
Well written code minimises the cost of change.

## Write code that is easy to delete.

## Matt's Patterns


### Process

### Architecture
  
### (Re)factoring

## No precogs
* You think you can predict the future
* You can't
* Do the best work with the requirements which you have

## Codebase Consistency
Everyone writes code the same way

## Four Eyes
* Code always have two sets of eyes on it.

## Architecture Patterns
### Monolith First
### Seeds not dumps
### Test to save your job
* what is most likely to break
* what would be the biggest nightmare
* what needs to work

## (Re)factoring patterns 26:37
* Seed each test - setup data in each test, don't do this up front.
### Custom Requests - for preparing data
* most controllers 1, get data, 2 process, 3 get data out

* not form requests.
* eg SignUpRequest - extending Illuminate Request class

### View Data Composition
#### Presenter  - layer on top of model (like decorator for views) 36 mins in

#### View Model - takes data in and exports the way you want
#### Responsible - interface for an object which can be converted into a response
#### View components -
