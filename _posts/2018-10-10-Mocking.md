# Testing HTTP Requests

Don't want to hit API everytime.

## PHP-VCR

Turn on, record

* Pull in with composer
* Guzzle is a dependency

Want to get the data without calling the API.

```
public function test_intercepts_successfully()
{
  VCR::turnOn();
  VCR::insertCassete('google');
  
  file_get_contents("www.google.com");
  
  VCR::eject();
  VCR::turnOff();
}

```

Next time it is called, it will use the file instead of making thre request.


Next level is adding listener to phpunit.xml.
Then you can just add @vcr comment.


Is VCR outdated?
